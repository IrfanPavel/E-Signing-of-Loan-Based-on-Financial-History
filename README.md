ESignature:

Electronic signatures aren’t exactly a novelty. They have been around since the American Civil War, during which contracts were signed through Morse. In a modern setting, an e-Sign refers to a unique, digitised, encrypted personal identifier. This is, in essence, different from the ‘wet’ signatures created by hand. The e-Sign is meant to complete transactions, loops, and agreements electronically.
